## DESCRIPTION:

**Minesweeper** is a good old game like the pre-installed game of the same name on Windows operating systems. In the game Minesweeper, with the help of suggestive hints, you need to neutralize all the mines on the field and not blow yourself up on them. Hints are numbers indicating how many mines are located around a given cell. To make it easier to remember the places with mines you suspect, these places can be marked with a flag.
